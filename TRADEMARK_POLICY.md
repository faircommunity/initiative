# Trademark Policy

## Version 1.0 | 2026

---

This Trademark Policy governs the use of names, marks, and identifiers associated with the Fair Community Initiative (FCI).

The purpose of this policy is to prevent confusion, preserve clarity, and protect the integrity of the Fair Community License (FCL) ecosystem.

---

## 1. Protected Marks

The following names and identifiers are considered marks of the Fair Community Initiative:

- **"Fair Community Initiative"**
- **"Fair Community License"**
- **"FCL"**
- **"FCL-Strict", "FCL-Standard", "FCL-Light", "FCL-Open", "FCL-Evolution"**
- Official FCI logos and visual assets
- Official FCL badges

These marks are protected to ensure that users can trust the licensing terms associated with them.

---

## 2. Permitted Use

You are encouraged to use the marks in the following contexts:

### 2.1 Accurate Reference

To truthfully describe that your project is licensed under a specific FCL version.
> *Example:* "Licensed under FCL-Standard v1.0"

### 2.2 Comparative Discussion

To reference FCI or FCL in commentary, analysis, academic work, or comparison.

### 2.3 Informational Documentation

To document compatibility, licensing status, or organizational compliance.

---

## 3. Restricted Use

To prevent "openwashing" and brand fragmentation, you **may not** use the marks:

### 3.1 In a Misleading Way

- Suggesting endorsement by FCI without prior written authorization.
- Implying governance authority or official partnership where none exists.
- Creating confusion about the official status of a license.

### 3.2 In Modified or Derivative Licenses

If you modify the text of an FCL license:

- You **must** rename the license.
- You **may not** call it "FCL", "Fair Community License", or any variation that implies it is an official FCI product.
- Names like "FCL-Modified" or "FCL-Pro" are strictly prohibited for derivative works.

### 3.3 In Commercial Branding

Using the marks as part of your product name, company name, or commercial brand in a way that suggests official affiliation or ownership by the FCI.

---

## 4. Forks and Derivatives

The Fair Community Initiative supports the evolution of licensing ideas. However, if you fork or adapt the license text:

- You must remove all references to "Fair Community License" and "FCL".
- You must provide a clear, distinct name for your derivative license.
- License text may be copyright-protected; brand identifiers are separately protected by this policy.

---

## 5. Use of Logos and Badges

Official logos and badges are provided to help the community identify compliant projects. They may be used:

- To indicate correct and unmodified license usage.
- In project READMEs and documentation.
- In educational material regarding Fair Community.

Logos may not be altered, recolored, or distorted without permission.

---

## 6. Certification and Official Status

Only the Fair Community Initiative may designate a project or license as:

- **"Official FCL License"**
- **"Certified FCL Implementation"**
- **"Fair Community Compliant"**

---

## 7. Enforcement

FCI reserves the right to request the removal of trademark use that causes confusion, misrepresents affiliation, or damages the integrity of the ecosystem. Our priority is always **dialogue and clarification** before pursuing formal remedies.

---

## 8. Open Collaboration and Brand Integrity

This policy does not restrict academic analysis, good-faith criticism, or forking under new names. It exists solely to prevent confusion and preserve the institutional clarity required for sustainable software licensing.

---

## 9. Policy Updates

This Trademark Policy may be updated in accordance with the Governance and Versioning documents of the Fair Community Initiative.
