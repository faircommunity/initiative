# ⚖️ Responsible Source-Available Perimeter

## *Defining Structural Boundaries for Sustainable Licensing*

**Fair Community Initiative (FCI)**
Responsible Source-Available Perimeter v1.0  
Official Release: 2026

---

## 1. Purpose: The Architecture of Constraint

The **Responsible Source-Available Perimeter** defines the normative boundaries within which all licenses under the Fair Community Initiative (FCI) must operate.

Its purpose is paradoxical but vital: **it exists not to expand restrictions, but to constrain them.**

Source-available licensing already exists as a fragmented market reality. This perimeter ensures that sustainability-driven restrictions do not devolve into arbitrary mechanisms of control. This document establishes the structural guardrails that distinguish **sustainable boundary design** from **extractive or anti-competitive behavior**.

## 2. Foundational Premise: Correcting Asymmetry

Source-available licensing is institutionally justified only when it addresses a **structural economic imbalance**, not when it serves vendor convenience, lock-in, or market dominance.

> Restrictions must exist to correct market asymmetry — not to create it.

---

## 3. Core Perimeter Principles

All licenses maintained under the FCI framework must adhere to the following constraints:

### 3.1 Minimal Extraction Principle

Restrictions may only target behaviors that directly threaten the sustainability of the originator. Specifically, they may only address:

* Direct monetization of the Software itself.
* Commercialization of its core functionality as a competing service (SaaS).
* Resale of the Software as a primary revenue-generating asset.

**The Bright Line:** Restrictions must **not** impair learning, research, internal experimentation, private modification, or independent forks for non-competing purposes.

### 3.2 No Behavioral Micromanagement

Licenses must be economic tools, not moral or operational ones. They must **not**:

* Regulate business models unrelated to the direct monetization of the Software.
* Impose field-of-use or "ethical" restrictions (which create legal fragmentation).
* Restrict categories of users based on identity, geography, or affiliation.

### 3.3 Transparency of Boundaries

Commercial boundaries must be explicitly defined using objective, functional criteria. Licenses must avoid vague moral language or ambiguous triggers that maximize licensor leverage through legal uncertainty.

### 3.4 Proportionality

Restrictions must be proportional to the sustainability objective. If a restriction blocks internal tooling, prevents non-commercial community forks, or chills academic experimentation, it exceeds the responsible perimeter.

### 3.5 Version Immutability & Non-Retroactivity

Predictability is the foundation of institutional legitimacy.

* License texts must be **immutable** for their specific version.
* Commercial boundaries cannot be retroactively expanded for existing releases.
* Rights granted under a specific version cannot be withdrawn.

### 3.6 Anti-Capture Safeguards

Stewardship of the license must be structurally decoupled from direct commercial exploitation. No single commercial actor may unilaterally alter terms or expand restrictions after a version has been adopted by the community.

### 3.7 Eventual Openness (Evolutionary Backstop)

The FCI encourages time-based transition models (e.g., **FCL-Evolution**) as a structural safeguard against permanent enclosure.

Where adopted, such models ensure that specific versions of software transition to a fully permissive license after a defined Protection Period.

While not mandatory for all FCI license variants, time-based openness strengthens long-term ecosystem convergence and reinforces the principle that sustainability mechanisms should not become indefinite barriers to public access.

## 4. Red Flags: Outside the Perimeter

The following patterns are considered **Outside the Responsible Perimeter** and fall outside responsible boundaries:

* **Retroactive Relicensing:** Changing terms for code already released under a more permissive model without explicit consent.
* **Identity-Targeting:** Restricting competitors based on their brand or name rather than specific economic behavior.
* **Governance Capture:** Licenses controlled by a single vendor without sunset clauses or independent oversight.
* **Intentional Ambiguity:** Using "gray area" language to maximize enforcement leverage over legitimate users.

---

## 5. Structural Objective: Convergence

The long-term objective of this perimeter is to reduce the "Wild West" of source-available licensing into a stable, predictable, and independently governed framework.

Without perimeter discipline, source-available licensing is indistinguishable from proprietary control. With perimeter discipline, it becomes a **legitimate sustainability architecture**.

---

## 6. Living Doctrine

This document may evolve through the FCI public RFC process. Any amendment must:

1. Preserve the **Minimal Extraction Principle**.
2. Preserve **Non-Retroactivity**.
3. Preserve **Institutional Neutrality**.
