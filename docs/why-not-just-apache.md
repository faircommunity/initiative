# Why Not Just Apache?

## A Fair Question

If permissive open-source licenses like Apache 2.0 already exist — why create the Fair Community License (FCL)?

This document explains the reasoning clearly and without hostility toward existing models.

**Apache 2.0 is a great license. It just solves a different problem.**

---

### 1. Apache 2.0 Optimizes for Freedom | FCL Optimizes for Sustainability

The Apache License 2.0 was designed to maximize adoption and minimize friction:

- ✅ Free commercial use  
- ✅ Free SaaS use  
- ✅ Free redistribution  
- ✅ Patent grant  

It assumes that openness alone creates a healthy ecosystem. For many projects, that is true. But modern infrastructure economics changed the equation.

Today, cloud providers can:

- Take an open-source project and host it at global scale.
- Monetize it as a managed service and outcompete the original creators.
- Contribute little or nothing back.

**Apache permits this. FCL exists for projects where that dynamic threatens sustainability.**

### 2. Apache Enables Extraction at Scale

Apache does not distinguish between a startup embedding your library in a product and a hyperscale cloud provider selling your software as a service. Both are equally permitted.

For many maintainers, this creates a **structural imbalance**: the entity with the most infrastructure captures the most value.

**FCL introduces boundaries where necessary:**

- Protection against unmanaged SaaS replication.
- Protection against standalone commercial resale.
- Optional time-based openness (**Evolution** model).

It does not reject openness; it refines it.

### 3. Apache Has No Built-In Sustainability Model

Apache is legally elegant — but economically neutral. It provides legal clarity, patent safety, and attribution rules, but it does not provide:

- Revenue alignment.
- Anti-parasitic safeguards.
- Time-based transition guarantees.

**FCL introduces economic design into licensing.** Sustainability is treated as an architectural requirement, not an afterthought.

---

### 4. Apache Is Binary. FCL Is Modular

Apache offers one posture: permissive openness. FCL offers a spectrum:

| License | Protection Level | Use Case |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **FCL-Strict** | High | Core proprietary technology |
| **FCL-Standard** | Balanced | Modern sustainable open projects |
| **FCL-Light** | Minimal | SDKs and adoption-focused tools |
| **FCL-Open** | Permissive | Equivalent spirit to Apache 2.0 |
| **FCL-Evolution** | Time-based | Protected today, open tomorrow |

FCL does not replace Apache; it gives creators optional economic strategies.

---

### 5. The Evolution Model Has No Apache Equivalent

One of FCL’s most distinctive features is **FCL-Evolution**. It guarantees:

- Protection during early commercial growth.
- **Automatic conversion** to a fully permissive license after a defined period.

Apache has no time-based sustainability mechanism. Evolution acknowledges a software lifecycle: **Protection enables survival; Openness ensures legacy.**

---

### 6. FCL Is Not Anti-Open Source

FCL does not claim that Apache is "wrong." It recognizes that:

- Some projects need maximal adoption.
- Some projects need balanced protection.
- Some projects need temporary commercial shielding.

**FCL-Open** exists precisely for projects that want full permissiveness. The initiative is not ideological opposition; it is **architectural diversification.**

### 7. Decision Matrix: When to Choose

**Choose Apache 2.0 if:**

- You want zero restrictions.
- You prioritize ecosystem standardization above all else.
- You are comfortable with hyperscale SaaS competition.
- Your business model does not depend on license-based protection.

**Choose FCL if:**

- You want sustainability safeguards.
- You want optional SaaS protection.
- You want structured evolution.
- You want to prevent unbalanced value extraction.

## Conclusion

Apache 2.0 maximizes **freedom**.
The Fair Community License family maximizes **sustainability** while preserving freedom where it matters most.

Open Source changed the world. **Fair Community adapts it to the world we have now.**

Both models have their place. The question is not which is "better", the question is:  **Which problem are you trying to solve?**
