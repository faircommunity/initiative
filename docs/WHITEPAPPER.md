# The Fair Community Framework

## A Structural Model for Sustainable Software Licensing

## Abstract

The Fair Community Framework proposes a structured middle ground between permissive open-source licensing and proprietary commercial models.

As software distribution shifted from on-premise delivery to hosted infrastructure and global cloud deployment, economic asymmetries emerged. Infrastructure-scale actors can monetize open projects without necessarily contributing proportionally to their long-term sustainability.

This paper introduces the Fair Community License (FCL) family as an institutional response to this structural imbalance. It defines the theoretical foundation, economic reasoning, governance architecture, and lifecycle approach that underpin the Fair Community Initiative.

The objective is not to replace Open Source, but to extend the licensing spectrum with predictable, sustainable alternatives.

## 1. The Structural Shift in Software Economics

### 1.1 From Distribution to Infrastructure

Historically, software value was realized through distribution of binaries and source code.

Modern cloud infrastructure allows:

- Instant global deployment
- Hosted monetization at scale
- API abstraction of underlying engines
- Revenue capture without code redistribution

This decouples software value extraction from software ownership.

---

### 1.2 The Asymmetry Problem

Permissive open-source licenses optimize for frictionless adoption.

However, when infrastructure actors monetize software as a managed service:

- The original maintainers may receive no proportional benefit.
- Competitive barriers disappear for well-capitalized entities.
- Sustainability depends on goodwill rather than structure.

This asymmetry is not a flaw of Open Source.
It is a consequence of economic scale.

---

## 2. The Licensing Spectrum

Software licensing today can be understood along a structural continuum:

| Model | Commercial Freedom | Creator Protection |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Permissive Open Source (MIT/Apache) | Maximum | Minimal |
| Copyleft (GPL/AGPL) | Conditional | Moderate |
| Source-Available | Variable | High |
| Proprietary | Restricted | Maximum |

The Fair Community Framework introduces structured models between permissive and proprietary extremes.

## 3. The Fair Community Principle

Fair Community rests on four structural principles:

1. **Broad Freedom to Build**
   - Learning
   - Internal use
   - Experimentation
   - Integration

2. **Bounded Commercial Extraction**
   - Restrictions apply when monetization becomes primary.
   - SaaS replication and direct resale may require licensing.

3. **Predictable Governance**
   - Version immutability
   - Non-retroactivity
   - Structured RFC process

4. **Lifecycle Awareness**
   - Software may transition from protective to permissive over time.

Fair Community does not oppose openness.
It formalizes sustainability.

## 4. The FCL Architecture

The Fair Community License (FCL) is implemented as a family of variants:

- **FCL-Strict** — Commercial use restricted.
- **FCL-Standard** — Internal and embedded use permitted; primary-asset and SaaS restricted.
- **FCL-Light** — High adoption; hosted-service restriction.
- **FCL-Open** — Fully permissive.
- **FCL-Evolution** — Time-based conversion to FCL-Open.

This modular architecture allows creators to select a sustainability posture appropriate to their strategic stage.

---

## 5. The Primary Asset Concept

The "Primary Asset" model addresses competitive replication.

Rather than restricting general commercial usage, FCL variants evaluate:

- Whether the software constitutes the core economic engine.
- Whether removal would fundamentally impair the product.
- Whether the product is marketed primarily on the basis of the software.

This allows embedded usage while limiting structural substitution.

---

## 6. The Evolution Model

FCL-Evolution introduces a time-based transition mechanism.

After a predefined period:

- Protective restrictions expire.
- The license converts to FCL-Open.
- The software becomes permanently permissive.

This model aligns:

- Short-term sustainability
- Long-term public good

It introduces lifecycle transparency into licensing.

---

## 7. Governance as Infrastructure

Fair Community is not only a license.
It is an institutional framework.

The Initiative formalizes:

- Governance process
- Release versioning
- Trademark integrity
- Advisory consultation
- Non-retroactive guarantees

Licensing stability becomes a structural asset.

---

## 8. Comparison to Existing Models

FCL differs from:

- **Business Source License (BSL):**
  - BSL converts after time, but often to GPL.
  - FCL-Evolution converts to a permissive variant.
  - FCL maintains structured multi-variant consistency.

- **Elastic License:**
  - Focused primarily on SaaS restriction.
  - FCL provides broader institutional framework.

- **Polyform Licenses:**
  - Use-case specific.
  - FCL defines an ecosystem model.

Fair Community emphasizes coherence and governance.

---

## 9. Limitations

Fair Community is not:

- A replacement for permissive Open Source.
- A guarantee of commercial success.
- A universal solution for all projects.

It is a structural option for projects requiring sustainable equilibrium.

---

## 10. Long-Term Vision

The Fair Community Initiative seeks to:

- Establish Fair Community as a recognized licensing category.
- Provide durable alternatives to ad hoc source-available models.
- Encourage structural transparency in sustainable licensing.
- Create institutional continuity beyond individual founders.

The initiative prioritizes durability over rapid adoption.

---

## Conclusion

Software ecosystems have evolved.

Licensing models must evolve with them.

The Fair Community Framework provides:

- Structural clarity
- Sustainable boundaries
- Predictable governance
- Lifecycle-aware openness

It does not diminish Open Source.
It expands the spectrum.
