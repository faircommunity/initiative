# The Fair Community Initiative Manifesto

## Version 1.0 | 2026

## A New Balance for Software

Software changed the world.

Open collaboration unlocked unprecedented innovation, distributed knowledge, and global creativity. But as the software ecosystem evolved, so did its economic realities.

Today, code can be deployed, hosted, and monetized at planetary scale. While this scale has enabled extraordinary growth, it has also exposed structural imbalances that challenge the sustainability of independent creators and small teams.

The **Fair Community Initiative (FCI)** exists to establish a new structural balance.

Not as a rejection of Open Source.  
Not as a retreat into proprietary isolation.  

But as a principled evolution in how we design sustainable software ecosystems.

## What Is Fair Community?

Fair Community is the belief that:

- Openness and sustainability are not opposites.
- Freedom to build must coexist with structural continuity.
- Transparency and commercial responsibility can align.
- Innovation thrives when creators can endure.

Fair Community is not about restricting participation.  
It is about preventing structural imbalance.

It is not anti-business.  
It is pro-ecosystem.

## Our Core Pillars

### 1. Sustainability Is Structural

Innovation requires time.  
Time requires continuity.  
Continuity requires sustainability.

When software becomes a core economic engine, licensing must acknowledge that reality.

Fair Community models allow broad experimentation, learning, and internal integration — while establishing boundaries when commercial extraction becomes the primary objective.

Sustainability is not a privilege.  
It is infrastructure.

---

### 2. Developers Build Freely

The freedom to learn, experiment, integrate, and innovate remains foundational.

Under Fair Community–oriented licenses:

- Developers can explore.
- Teams can prototype.
- Organizations can integrate internally.
- Ecosystems can grow.

Restrictions begin only where direct commercial reselling, competitive replication, or structural hosted monetization would undermine the long-term viability of the original creators.

Freedom remains broad.  
Boundaries remain precise.

---

### 3. Trust Is a Public Good

Predictability builds confidence.

The Fair Community Initiative commits to:

- Transparent governance.
- Immutable license releases.
- Non-retroactive versioning.
- Public documentation of change.

Community contributions should not vanish behind sudden closures. License evolution must be structured, not impulsive.

**Trust is not marketing. It is architecture. Governance is not a private asset; it is a shared responsibility.**

---

### 4. Software Has a Lifecycle

Software is not static.

Some projects require protective phases to establish sustainability. Others may mature into fully permissive public goods.

Through models like **FCL-Evolution**, Fair Community recognizes that protection and openness can coexist across time.

Protection can enable growth.  
Growth can enable openness.  
Openness can become legacy.

Fair Community supports this lifecycle.

## The Fair Community License (FCL)

The **Fair Community License (FCL)** is the primary implementation of the Fair Community Initiative’s principles.

Its variants reflect different strategic needs:

- **FCL-Strict** — Strong commercial protection.
- **FCL-Standard** — Balanced sustainability and adoption.
- **FCL-Light** — High adoption with hosted-service boundaries.
- **FCL-Open** — Fully permissive collaboration.
- **FCL-Evolution** — Structured transition toward openness.

Each variant exists within a coherent framework guided by the principles of Fair Community.

---

## An Initiative for the Next Era

The Fair Community Initiative is not a reaction.  
It is a structural proposal.

It recognizes that:

- The scale of infrastructure has changed.
- The economics of software have changed.
- The sustainability requirements of creators have changed.

And licensing must evolve accordingly.

Fair Community seeks not to replace Open Source, but to complement it — by offering structured alternatives where sustainability must be explicit.

---

## Join the Fair Community

This is an invitation.

To creators who want durability. To developers who value clarity. To teams building long-term ecosystems. To organizations seeking principled alignment.

**We invite leaders to help steward these standards, ensuring they remain independent and robust for the decades to come.** Fair Community is not about control. It is about continuity.

> A healthy ecosystem allows everyone to grow — without exhausting those who build it.
