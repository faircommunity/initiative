# Fair Community Initiative (FCI) Governance  

## Version 1.0 | 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the operational and decision-making framework of the **Fair Community Initiative (FCI)**.

It establishes:

- Institutional roles  
- Decision procedures  
- License evolution mechanics  
- Structural independence protections  

This Governance document complements the FCI Charter and governs institutional process.

---

## 2. Governance Architecture

FCI operates under a multi-stakeholder stewardship structure designed to ensure:

- Institutional durability and neutrality  
- Distributed authority  
- Protection against single-actor control  

**All institutional authority is vested in the Steering Council, not in any individual.**

---

## 3. Steering Council

### 3.1 Role

The Steering Council is the primary decision-making body of the Initiative.

It is responsible for:

- Approval of Major license versions  
- Governance amendments  
- Strategic oversight  
- Institutional continuity  

---

### 3.2 Composition & Terms

- **3 to 9 Seats**, balanced across:
  - Legal expertise  
  - Industry participation  
  - Independent community contributors  

- **Diversity Rule:** No single corporate entity may occupy more than one Seat simultaneously.

- **Terms:** Members serve 2-year renewable terms.  
  Terms should be staggered when feasible to preserve continuity.

---

## 4. Transitional Stewardship (Sunset Clause)

During the initial stabilization phase, the Founding Steward may exercise tie-breaking authority in Council votes.

This authority automatically sunsets upon the earlier of:

- Three (3) years from adoption of this Governance; or  
- Expansion to at least five (5) active Council members.

After sunset, no individual retains unilateral or tie-breaking authority.

This clause ensures institutional independence beyond founding individuals.

---

## 5. Advisory Board & Maintainers

### 5.1 Advisory Board

Provides non-binding strategic guidance on structural revisions and ethical alignment.

**The Advisory Board holds no voting authority.**

---

### 5.2 Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for operational repository management, including:

- Pull request review  
- Documentation updates  
- RFC coordination  

Operational authority does not imply institutional voting authority.

---

## 6. Decision-Making Framework

### 6.1 Lazy Consensus

Routine administrative matters follow a **7-day review period**.

If no substantial objection is raised within that period, the proposal is considered adopted.

---

### 6.2 Formal Voting (Major Decisions)

Formal voting is required for:

- Major license revisions  
- Governance amendments  
- Structural institutional changes  

Approval requires:

- **Quorum:** Participation by more than 50% of active Council members.  
- **Supermajority:** At least two-thirds (2/3) of votes cast must approve.  

No single individual may override a failed Council vote.

---

## 7. License Evolution & Public RFC

Major revisions require:

1. Publication of a Draft  
2. A minimum **30-day Public RFC period**  
3. Public documentation summarizing material feedback  
4. Final Council vote  

All released license versions are immutable and remain permanently archived.

---

## 8. Anti-Capture Protections

To preserve structural neutrality:

- Funding does not grant governance rights.  
- Entities contributing more than 25% of annual funding must be publicly disclosed.  
- Council members must disclose material conflicts of interest.  
- Governance authority may not be contractually conditioned on sponsorship.

---

## 9. Continuity Safeguard

If Council membership falls below quorum:

- Remaining members may appoint interim members by majority vote.  
- If no Council remains active, Maintainers may initiate a public reconstruction process.  

In all cases, preservation of institutional continuity and public trust shall take precedence over procedural rigidity.
