# Fair Community Initiative (FCI) Charter  

## Version 1.0 | 2026

---

## 1. Institutional Identity

The **Fair Community Initiative (FCI)** is an independent, globally oriented stewardship and research body dedicated to the development, governance, and study of sustainable software licensing frameworks.

FCI operates as a jurisdiction-neutral initiative and is not bound to any specific national legal system. Its mission is structural rather than political.

FCI exists to:

- Design and steward licensing models that balance openness and sustainability.
- Promote predictable, transparent governance of licensing frameworks.
- Conduct neutral research on digital infrastructure sustainability.
- Preserve long-term trust in community-oriented software ecosystems.

FCI is not a commercial entity and does not exist to maximize profit or shareholder value.

---

## 2. Mission and Scope

FCI fulfills its mission through three primary domains:

### 2.1 Licensing Stewardship

- Maintaining and publishing official texts of the Fair Community License (FCL) family.
- Managing versioning, release processes, and non-retroactivity guarantees.
- Preserving historical license archives.

### 2.2 Governance Infrastructure

- Defining structured processes for change.
- Ensuring transparency in major decisions.
- Preventing structural capture by single stakeholders.

### 2.3 Research and Education

- Publishing research and whitepapers.
- Conducting comparative licensing analysis.
- Developing sustainability frameworks for digital ecosystems.

FCI does not provide legal advice and does not enforce licenses on behalf of third parties.

## 3. Foundational Principles

All activities of the Initiative must adhere to the following principles:

- **Transparency:** All structural changes must be publicly documented.
- **Predictability:** No retroactive revocation of rights granted under prior versions.
- **Sustainability:** Bounded commercial limitations to prevent structural extraction.
- **Proportional Freedom:** Preserving access for learning, research, and internal use.
- **Institutional Continuity:** Designed to survive beyond its founding individuals.

## 4. Relationship to the Fair Community License (FCL)

The FCL family is the primary licensing framework maintained by FCI. Each variant must explicitly define its commercial boundaries and stay aligned with this Charter.

---

## 5. Governance Structure

### 5.1 The Steering Council

The primary decision-making body (3–9 members). No single corporate entity may hold more than one Council seat simultaneously. Represents legal, industry, and community interests.

### 5.2 Transitional Stewardship (The Sunset Clause)

The Founding Steward serves in a transitional capacity. This authority automatically sunsets upon:

- Three (3) years from adoption; or  
- Establishment of a Council with at least five active members.
After sunset, the Founding Steward becomes **Steward Emeritus**, holding no executive authority.

### 5.3 Advisory Board

A consultative body providing non-binding guidance on major revisions and ethical alignment.

### 5.4 Decision-Making

Prioritizes **Lazy Consensus**. Structural changes require a **supermajority (2/3) vote** of the Council and a mandatory public RFC process.

---

## 6. Funding and Independence

FCI may accept funding provided that:

- No single entity contributes more than **25% of annual funding** without public disclosure.  
- Financial contributions grant no governance authority or veto power.

---

## 7. Global Scope and Language

The official language is **English**. Translations are for accessibility only. The Initiative seeks geographic diversity in governance.

---

## 8. Change and Versioning

Historical versions remain publicly accessible and valid for projects that adopted them. Adopters must explicitly opt-in to new versions.

---

## 9. Dissolution Safeguard

If the Initiative ceases operations, all official license texts shall remain publicly accessible. No historical license shall be retroactively withdrawn.

---

## 10. Commitment to Institutional Maturity

Formal legal incorporation will occur when governance is distributed, adoption is material, and sustainable funding exists.
