# Roadmap

## Version 1.0 | 2026

---

This Roadmap outlines the intended strategic direction of the Fair Community Initiative (FCI). It reflects current priorities and may evolve in accordance with our [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md) and [Versioning](./VERSIONING_POLICY.md) policies.

The objective is **institutional durability** — not rapid expansion.
