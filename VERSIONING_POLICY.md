# Versioning Policy

## Version 1.0 | 2026

---

This document defines the official versioning model for all licenses maintained by the Fair Community Initiative (FCI), including the Fair Community License (FCL) family.

The objective of this policy is to ensure stability, predictability, and legal clarity across license evolution.

---

## 1. General Principles

1. License versions are immutable once published.
2. New versions do not retroactively modify rights granted under previous versions.
3. Projects may choose which license version to adopt.
4. All historical versions will remain publicly accessible.

---

## 2. Version Format

FCI licenses follow a semantic-inspired versioning format:

Examples:

- FCL-Standard v1.0
- FCL-Standard v1.1
- FCL-Strict v2.0

Patch-level releases (e.g., 1.0.1) may be used only for strictly non-substantive corrections.

---

## 3. Version Categories

### 3.1 Major Versions (v2.0, v3.0, etc.)

A Major version is required when:

- The legal framework changes materially.
- Commercial boundaries are expanded or reduced.
- Definitions (e.g., "Hosted Service", "Primary Asset") are modified in substance.
- The scope of permitted or prohibited use changes.
- A new structural licensing philosophy is introduced.

Major versions must undergo the formal RFC process defined in the Governance document.

---

### 3.2 Minor Versions (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)

A Minor version may be issued for:

- Clarification of language.
- Improved definitions that do not alter legal intent.
- Structural reorganization of text.
- Removal of ambiguity without expanding or reducing rights.
- Correction of inconsistencies between license variants.

Minor versions should not materially alter the rights or obligations of licensees.

---

### 3.3 Patch Versions (v1.0.1)

Patch versions may be issued only for:

- Typographical errors.
- Formatting corrections.
- Non-substantive grammatical fixes.

Patch releases must not change meaning, scope, or interpretation.

---

## 4. License Immutability

Once a version is published:

- Its text must not be modified.
- Any correction requiring textual change must result in a new version number.
- The original text must remain archived and publicly accessible.

Repositories must clearly indicate when a project is using:

- FCL-Standard v1.0
- FCL-Standard v1.1
- etc.

---

## 5. Project Adoption Model

Projects adopting an FCI license must explicitly specify:

- The license variant.
- The version number.

Example:

Licensed under FCL-Standard v1.0

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, adoption of a license version does not imply automatic upgrade to future versions.

Projects may voluntarily upgrade to newer versions.

---

## 6. Deprecation Policy

FCI may designate older versions as "Deprecated" for new projects.

Deprecation:

- Does not invalidate existing use.
- Does not revoke rights.
- Serves only as forward-looking guidance.

Deprecated versions remain legally valid.

---

## 7. Public Documentation

Each version release must include:

- A changelog.
- A clear summary of differences from the previous version.
- An effective publication date.
- A public archive entry.

---

## 8. Integrity of the Versioning Model

Version numbers must not be reused.

The Initiative shall not:

- Reissue a version with altered text.
- Retroactively reinterpret license language without formal version release.
- Modify commercial boundaries without incrementing the appropriate version category.

---

## 9. Future Extensions

If the FCI introduces new license families or structural frameworks, those licenses must adopt a versioning system consistent with this policy unless explicitly documented otherwise.
