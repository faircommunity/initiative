# Contributing to the Fair Community Initiative (FCI)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Fair Community Initiative.

FCI exists to steward sustainable software licensing frameworks. Contributions help improve clarity, strengthen structural integrity, and ensure long-term trust in the Fair Community License (FCL) ecosystem.

This document outlines how to participate constructively.

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

Contributions to FCI should align with the Initiative’s core principles:

- Transparency
- Predictability
- Sustainability
- Structural clarity
- Non-retroactive trust

FCI is not a general-purpose software project. It is a licensing governance initiative. **Precision and stability take priority over speed.**

## 2. What You Can Contribute

### 2.1 License Text Review

## 3. How to Propose Changes

### Step 1 — Open an Issue

Before submitting a Pull Request involving material changes:

- Open a GitHub Issue to describe the concern or proposal.
- Provide clear rationale and reference specific sections.

### Step 2 — Discussion

Minor clarifications may be reviewed directly by Maintainers. Material structural changes will follow the **RFC procedure** defined in the [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md) document.

### Step 3 — Submit a Pull Request

When submitting a PR:

- Keep scope narrowly defined (avoid bundling unrelated changes).
- Indicate whether the proposal may require a version increment (Major/Minor).

---

## 4. RFC Process for Major Changes

If a proposal introduces changes to commercial boundaries, redefinition of core terms, or new license variants, it must undergo a **Public Request for Comments (RFC)** process (minimum 30-day review).

---

## 5. Decision-Making Model

FCI follows a structured governance model. While we value community input, final determinations regarding license texts and core principles remain with the **Steering Council** and the **Founding Steward**.

---

## 6. Code of Conduct

All participation must adhere to the FCI Code of Conduct. We expect professional discourse, respectful disagreement, and evidence-based reasoning.

---

## 7. Intellectual Contributions

By submitting a contribution, you agree that:

- You retain ownership of your work.
- You grant the FCI the right to incorporate your contribution into official documents.
- Contributions may be modified or integrated into future versions of the ecosystem.

---

## 8. Scope Limitations

FCI does not provide individualized legal advice, offer license interpretation for specific disputes, or arbitrate conflicts between third parties.
